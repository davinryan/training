## DOMC Question Tips
* Do not rush. Think carefully about how each option relates to the question
* If you do not see a clear and specific connection to the question, it is safest to assume the option is incorrect
* Treat each option independently, as more than one answer may be correct
* If an option feels vaguely familiar, pause and think about why. Try to recall the exact context in which you’ve seen 
it before. The exam often tests small but important distinctions between similar concepts, so make sure your answer 
fits the question precisely rather than relying on general recognition
* Read the question stem closely before you start answering; subtle wording often changes what counts as correct
